          Cappadocia, a semi-arid region in central Turkey, is known for its
          distinctive <a href="#">“fairy chimneys,”</a> tall, cone-shaped rock
          formations clustered in Monks Valley,

          Other notables sites include Bronze Age homes carved into valley walls
          by troglodytes (cave dwellers) and later used as refuges by early
          Christians. The 100m-deep Ihlara Canyon houses numerous rock-face
          churches.

          As if plucked from a whimsical fairytale and set down upon the stark
          Anatolian plains, Cappadocia is a geological oddity of honeycombed
          hills and towering boulders of otherworldly beauty. The fantastical
          topography is matched by the human history here. People have long
          utilised the region's soft stone, seeking shelter underground and
          leaving the countryside scattered with fascinating cavern
          architecture.

          are the most famous sights, while simply bedding down in one of
          Cappadocia's cave hotels is an experience in 21st-century cave living.
